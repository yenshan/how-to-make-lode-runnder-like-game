# Demos

There are some demos that show the process of making a Lode Runner-like game.

This project is shared as a learning resource, and there are no plans for future updates.

## How to run demos

To play the game locally, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the game folder.
2. Start a simple HTTP server with the following command:
   
   ```bash
   python3 -m http.server
   ```

3. Open your web browser and enter "localhost:8000" in the address bar to start the game.

Enjoy!
